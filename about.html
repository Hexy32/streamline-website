              <p>
                Streamline is a whitelist-only Minecraft vanilla SMP that
                promotes a “economy” that is diamond-based. We have a free build
                system allowing you to build almost anywhere you want, without
                many limitations.

              <p>
                We do not publicly release the seed for the season until after
                it is over. For concern that people will use it to find things
                that would have otherwise taken much longer to find.

                The server is paid for by donations, the server is hosted by a
                3rd party hosting company and most of the money for the server
                comes from donations.

                No, there is no way to buy ways foward in the server using real
                money, if you dontate you only get things that don't effect your
