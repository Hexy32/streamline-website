            <h2>ECONOMY:</h2>
            <p>
              The economy on Streamline is based on diamonds, it works much like
              the real economy, with buys and sales using one central currency.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can become a tycoon and make thousands of diamonds, or you can
              just stop by the shopping district whenever you need some
              materials.
            </p>
            <p>
              The economy adds incredible potential to everyone's experience and
              it speeds up the survival gameplay allowing you to skip to what
              you love!

            <h2>NO CLAIMING:</h2>
            <p>
              Streamline is a whitelist-only Minecraft server, meaning there is
              no need for those annoying claim features you find on public SMPs.

            <h2>A SERVER FOR ALL:</h2>
            <p>
              The entire point of Streamline in the first place was to create a
              whitelist server that anyone who wants to join, can. We have
              overwhelmingly accomplished that goal, with an incredibly diverse
              community of people all around the world and all different
              backgrounds!
            </p>
            <p>
              It doesn't matter where you're from or who you are, we support
              everyone! We love each and every player that joins Streamline and
              look forward to anyone that wants to be a part of our community.

            <h2>TRUST-BASED RULES:</h2>
            <p>
              With trust-based rules there is no need for pesky plugins or
              limitations getting in the way of your gameplay.
            </p>
            <p>
              Streamliners never need to deal with getting around build
              restrictions or annoying alerts.
